## Pokemon images for one shot learning
We have used meta learning paradigm - Siamese Neural Network for One Shot Image Recognition [one-shot-learning](https://sorenbouma.github.io/blog/oneshot/).  

## Dataset description
There are three directories,   
"pokemon-a" and "pokemon-b" are standard pokemon images with no background. One can use them for training.  
"pokemon-tcg-images" are pokemon images cropped from pokemon tcg card. They are for testing.  
Filenames in all directories start with pokemon-id, aka class label.
